            <p>If you've grown accustomed to lackluster hot chocolate made from ripping open an envelope of powder and pouring it into a cup of hot water, I'm here to tell you that real hot chocolate awaits. And it's just as easy to make. Rich, thick, and velvety smooth, hot chocolate is made using a few simple ingredients that make all the difference.

Read on to learn how to make the best hot chocolate from scratch</p>
